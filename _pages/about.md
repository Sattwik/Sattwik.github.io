I am a fourth-year graduate student in the [Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics group](https://nqp.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Jelena Vućkovič](https://web.stanford.edu/~jela/). I received my Bachelor of Technology (Electrical Engineering) degree from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2018.

My research interests till date have broadly included quantum optics and quantum control theory. Recently, I have also been interested in variational quantum algorithms, and tensor network methods for quantum many-body physics and machine learning.
