I am a fifth-year graduate student in the [Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics group](https://nqp.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Jelena Vućkovič](https://web.stanford.edu/~jela/). I received my Bachelor of Technology (Electrical Engineering) degree from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2018.

My research experience has been both theoretical and numerical in nature and has broadly involved applying tools from optimization theory to problems in quantum computing and quantum optics. I am currently looking for industry positions.
